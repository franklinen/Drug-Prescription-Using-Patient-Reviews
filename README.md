# Natural Language Processing Based Drug Prescription Using Patient Reviews #

## Introduction and Problem Statement ##
Drug prescription errors are common and result in serious complications in patients.For most people with no access to doctors or with common ailments that requires no physician attention or prescription, they have to rely on word of mouth recommendation or historical use. However, newer effective drugs often replace older ones and therefore extracting and standardizing patient reviews will to improve the predictive power of the reviews and usefulness factor.

## Summary ##
*We have developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based model for predicting the right medication for a particular condition based on paient reviews of the medication and usefulness factor calculation.*

## Aims ##
**Apply NLP and standard medical terminologies to preprocess input features.**
**Design and evaluate machine learning model.**
**Improve model performance**
**Package Model in App**
**Deploy model in Development using Docker**
**Deploy Model in Production using Google Cloud**

## Data Source ##
input data that contain patient reviews and medical conditions. 

Data for medications and reasons should be input in CSV format. 


## How to run ##
We describe below a tutorial for executing the prescription forecasting code using sample raw data.
