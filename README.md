# NLP Drug Prescription Using Patient Reviews #


# Overview
## Problem Statement ##
Identifying, resolving, and preventing drug therapy problems are the unique contributions of the pharmaceutical care practitioner. However, depending on the pharmaceutical care practitioner to gather enough data for assessment may not be sufficient. This is where patient reviews of drugs helps to supplement the pharmaceutical care practitioner's data and help review drug performance. In addition, such reviews may help drug companies determine effective forms of a pharmaceutical product, showing the ones to discotinue in production and the ones to focus on in production. An effective way to analyse reviews and make recommendations is the use of natural language processing and classification modeling for prediction. For most people with no access to doctors or with common ailments that requires no physician attention or prescription, they have to rely on word of mouth recommendation or historical use. However, newer effective drugs often replace older ones and therefore extracting and standardizing patient reviews will help to improve the predictive power of the reviews and usefulness factor.

## Models ##

## Summary ##
*We have developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based model for predicting the right medication for a particular condition based on paient reviews of the medication and usefulness factor calculation.*

## Aims ##
**Apply NLP and standard medical terminologies to preprocess input features.**

**Design and evaluate machine learning model.**

**Improve model performance**

**Package Model in App**

**Deploy model in Development using Docker**

**Deploy Model in Production using Google Cloud**

## Data Source ##
input data that contain patient reviews and medical conditions. 

Data for medications and reasons should be input in CSV format. 


## How to run ##
We describe below a tutorial for executing the prescription forecasting code using sample raw data.
